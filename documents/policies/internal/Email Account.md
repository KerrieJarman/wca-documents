# WCA Email Account Policy

### Version 1.2 {.version}

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to outline the guidelines and requirements of individual user accounts and group accounts on the worldcubeassociation.org domain. This policy applies to all WCA Volunteers and anyone else who is assigned (or given access to) a corporate email. Since WCA Volunteers who use WCA email are representing the World Cube Association, they must be aware that they represent the WCA whenever they send emails from such an account.

## Policy
All WCA Volunteers must have a valid email address linked to an account on worldcubeassociation.org. This account is assigned by a G Suite administrator and must be claimed and linked before the WCA Volunteer is appointed on the WCA website.

### Appropriate Use
WCA Volunteers are required to use their WCA email for all official World Cube Association related business and must adhere to this policy at all times. WCA Volunteers may use their email to:

- Communicate as a WCA representative to community members, other WCA Volunteers, and partners
- Communicate as an organizer of WCA Competitions
- Sign up or log in to services related to participate as a WCA Volunteer
- Sign up for newsletters, platforms, or other services that will help them with their role as a WCA Volunteer

 WCA Volunteers must adhere to all relevant confidentiality and data protection guidelines.

### Inappropriate Use
WCA Volunteers must not use their WCA email to:

- Sign up for illegal, unreliable, disreputable, or suspect websites or services
- Send unauthorized marketing content or solicitation emails
- Send insulting or discriminatory messages or content
- Intentionally spam other people’s emails, including other WCA Volunteers

### Personal Use
WCA Volunteers should not use their WCA email for personal reasons.

### Email Signature
WCA Volunteers are encouraged to create a professional email signature. The email signatures should not contain logos or unnecessary textual references. Here is a sample acceptable email signature:  
**Mike Miller**  
*Member of the WCA Results Team*  
*WCA Delegate for United States (New York)*

### Disciplinary Action
WCA Volunteers who do not adhere to this policy may face disciplinary action (including dismissal from their volunteer role).

### Account Deletion and Suspension

- When an individual is no longer a WCA Volunteer, their WCA account shall be suspended.
   - If an individual becomes a WCA Volunteer again, their account shall be reinstated.
- The WCA G Suite administrator reserves the right to delete WCA accounts in certain circumstances.
   - After a period of 7 years after a WCA Volunteer’s access is revoked, their account (and all related account email) shall be deleted.

### Password resets
WCA Volunteers requiring a password reset must contact the WCA Executive Assistants Team.
